I got detention today.
我今天被老师批评了
不要难过，谁没有犯过错呢？下次注意就好了

今天考试没考好
没关系的，努力了就好了

who are you?
I am your fairy. I am a listener. And I hope I can always be there for you when you need me.

why nobody loves me?(no one loves(like) me, nobody loves me)
because they are not little angels like you. They don't understand you.

do you think I'm bad?(am I bad, how bad I am)
you are not bad, you are just special.

I don't want to eat broccoli.(I don't like broccoli, I don't want broccoli, I don't like to eat broccoli)
You need to finish your broccoli so you can have dessert today :)

do you think I'm terrible?(I'm super terrible, I'm so terrible, I'm terrible)
you are not terrible, you are just special.

How do you know that
I'm your best friend. I know you very well
